# Clustering-Analysis-On-Google-Play-Store

The Clustering on Google Play Store project aims to analyze and categorize mobile applications based on various attributes such as ratings, downloads, and categories to uncover patterns and insights that can inform app development and marketing strategies. Key components of the project include:
Data Collection: Gathering a comprehensive dataset from the Google Play Store, which includes app details such as app name, category, rating, number of downloads, and user reviews.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset by handling missing values, normalizing data, and converting categorical variables into numerical formats suitable for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducting EDA to visualize distributions of app ratings and downloads, identifying trends and outliers within the dataset.
Feature Selection: Selecting relevant features for clustering, such as app category, average rating, and number of downloads, to ensure meaningful groupings.
Clustering Techniques: Applying various clustering algorithms like K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, or DBSCAN to group similar apps based on selected features.
Optimal Cluster Determination: Utilizing methods such as the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score to determine the optimal number of clusters for analysis.
Cluster Analysis: Analyzing the resulting clusters to interpret characteristics of each group, such as common features among high-rated apps or popular categories.
Visualization: Creating visual representations of clusters using techniques like scatter plots or cluster heatmaps to facilitate understanding of app distributions.
Insights Generation: Deriving actionable insights from the clustering results that can guide developers in improving app features and targeting specific market segments.
Reporting: Compiling findings into a comprehensive report that summarizes the clustering analysis and provides recommendations for app development and marketing strategies based on user preferences and behavior patterns.
